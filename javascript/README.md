# JavaScript Programming Exercises

JavaScript/Node.js implementations of programming exercises and algorithms.

## Structure

- `src/games/` - Game implementations
- `src/algorithms/` - Algorithm implementations  
- `src/datastructures/` - Data structure implementations
- `test/` - Unit tests

## Requirements

- Node.js 16 or higher
- npm 8 or higher

## Building and Running

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run a specific program (e.g., Noughts and Crosses)
npm start
```

## Current Exercises

### Games
- **Noughts and Crosses** - Coming soon (JavaScript port of Java version)

## Adding New Exercises

1. Create your implementation in the appropriate `src/` subdirectory
2. Add corresponding tests in the `test/` directory
3. Follow JavaScript naming conventions (camelCase)
4. Use ES6+ features where appropriate
